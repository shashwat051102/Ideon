# Voice Lab Notes

My default tone: conversational, analytical, occasionally metaphorical. I avoid jargon unless it earns its keep. Examples carry more weight than adjectives.

Sentence rhythm: mostly short to medium, with the occasional longer cadence to weave context. I use lists to compress complexity. I end sections with a forward-looking question—“What’s the next smallest experiment we can run?”
