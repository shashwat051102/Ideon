# On Creativity, Constraints, and Small Steps

Creativity rarely arrives as a thunderclap; it sneaks in as a whisper. I prefer small steps over grand gestures. One clear paragraph. One specific example. One honest question.

Constraints help. When I set a 20-minute timer and a two-sentence rule per idea, the work flows. It’s like gardening with raised beds—limited space sharpens attention.

I lean on metaphors to make the abstract tactile. If an idea is a seed, then drafts are soil tests. Some fail. Some sprout. A few bloom into essays that carry their own momentum.

Let’s imagine a practice that rewards patience: note, connect, revisit. Thread by thread, patterns emerge—nothing mystical, just consistent attention. Simple beats clever. Rhythm matters. Clarity wins.
