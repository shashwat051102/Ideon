# Thinking Patterns I Trust

I trust questions more than answers. “What’s the simplest next move?” beats “What’s the perfect plan?” I prefer parallel structures—ask, test, learn; note, link, reflect.

Ambiguity isn’t a bug. It’s a signal that we should zoom in. I sketch ideas as nodes and edges: concepts first, connections second. Over time, clusters form—education, ethics, tooling.

When the writing slows, I switch mediums: a quick diagram, a bulleted outline, a spoken note. The goal is momentum, not polish. Progress compounds through small, steady cycles.
