# Ideon

A local AI-powered idea generation and exploration platform.

Note: Environment variables previously prefixed with IDEAWEAVER_* are still supported for backward compatibility. You can use the new IDEON_* variants (e.g., IDEON_USE_LLM) or the legacy names.

Docker note: If you're using a pre-built image or local tags like `ideaweaver:latest`, the application inside now identifies as Ideon. You can keep existing tags or retag to `ideon:latest` when convenient.
